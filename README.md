Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass wanted to create an online driver education system that could be accessed from any internet-connected device including both comptuers and mobile devices. They wanted the system to be able to handle user registrations, purchasing of learning packages, student/teacher appointments, and several maintenance operations.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did a good job of imagining what the system would need to do and laying out the details in the business requirements document. I realized that it can be quite difficult to break a general client idea down into all the little pieces that would be required to bring it to life in a computer system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I would try some different approaches to making use case diagrams. I had quite a bit of difficulty in trying to organize everything I wanted in a single diagram that didn't just turn into a mass of criss-crossed lines. This is definitely something I will need to practice a bit more to improve my end results, especially for more complicate systems.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I tried to imagine what a user of the system would be trying to do with it and how they would expect the system to react and guide them along to their goal. It's very easy to over-complicate things or assume that a user knows more about computers and how they work than they actually do. I think the user has to be considered every step of the way. One needs to consider what the user needs to see, and what they shouldn't see. We need to make sure that above all else, the finished system is actually usable. A system that can perform all sorts of complex computations isn't going to be very good if the users has to perform even more complex operations to get their job done when using it.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I try my best to look at what the client wants the system to help them achieve and the types of users that will need to interact the final product. I think  it is first important to design a system that will do the work and provide the information that the client needs. Once it's understood how to do that, there needs to be careful consideration about who is going to use the system and how we can make things as painless as possible for them so that they can do their work efficiently. I think a well designed system is one that the clients will never even think about. They will just use it because it is there and it does what they need it to do the way they want to do it. They will spend their time working rather than trying to figure out how to get the system to give them the result they want. The customer should never have to come up with tricks or workarounds, to get what they want and they shouldn't have to spend more than a minimal amount of time educating employees on how to use it.
